			<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
			<p>The receiver antenna location picks up signals in southern and westerly direction mostly
			and does badly in easterly and nothernly directions. The maximum distance is around 70km, but
			sometimes it loses track because of geography and built-up areas in between.</p>
			<h3>Data Quality</h3>
			<p>After a summary comparision with <a href="https://flightaware.com">Flightaware</a> data,
			the receiver and application seem to be doing a quite good job.
			Sometimes the receiver sees planes that are not on Flightaware, and sometimes it misses
			a plane, but overall it's comparable data quality.</p>
			<h3>Data Retention and Storage</h3>
			<p>The application currently does not retain data in an archive, it's real-time display only,
			with no archived data.</p>
			<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
			<p>While this site is our work, it relies on work done by others who chose to make their
			work available. A list of sources can be found <a href="/acknowledgements.txt">here</a>.</p>
